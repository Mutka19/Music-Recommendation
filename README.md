One thing we enjoyed about this project was being able to implement our own idea. That being said we decided on a music discovery page that implements a Spotify API
which is really neat to use. 
Another topic we enjoyed was being able to display the recommendations from spotify based off user input. The idea that its not hardcoded and changes dynamically is very
cool.
One thing we didn't enjoy was initially setting up the spotify api. It took a bit to figure it out altough it is a cool feature to use.
Another thing that was a little annoying was making sure the music info we use to find recommendations was accurate and didn't pull garbage data. We figured out 
the formatting to use the information to accurately display recommendations.
